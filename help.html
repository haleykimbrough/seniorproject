                Pain Link is a website that helps patients identify factors that can 
                trigger spikes in pain. You can enter a variety of information and Pain Link
                will show your pain levels from each day on a chart. It will also store this data
                and display the factors that are often present with higher than normal pain levels.  
                When data is present multiple times during spikes in pain it can be an indicator that
                that specific factor might be causing your pain to be worse.
